# 2D Matrix Class in C++

This project provides a robust and efficient implementation of a 2D Matrix class in C++. The class encapsulates a 
two-dimensional dynamic array, offering functionalities to manipulate numerical data in a tabular format.

The 2D Matrix class supports a variety of operations such as:

- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Scalar multiplication and division
- Transposition
- Determinant and inverse calculation (for square matrices)
- Accessing and modifying elements at specific row and column indices

This class can be used in a wide range of applications including mathematical computations, image processing, game development, 
and data analysis. It is designed with performance and ease-of-use in mind, providing a simple and intuitive interface for manipulating 2D matrices.
